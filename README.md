Dear Everyone <br>
Good morning! <br>
<br>
Subject: second repository <br>
<br>
This is my second repository. This is a dataframe giving information on the planets in the Solar system, 
downloaded using the seaborn package. The mean, maximum and minimum values of the orbital periods, masses and 
distances of the planets have been found using the describe function. The dataframe has been sorted according to 
orbital period in ascending order. The notebook also has a plot of the orbital periods, masses 
and distances of the planets at the end.

<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
Narayanan Arvind
